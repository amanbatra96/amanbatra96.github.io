Currently I am pursuing a PhD at the Centre for Systems and Control of IIT Bombay. I am fascinated by the tools in applied mathematics and am striving to learn these well in hope to apply them to diverse applications. I will be using this website for both - updating my professional experience and sharing my personal thoughts.

You can find my CV [here](/cv) . To view my publications please click [here](/publications/).

On the extracurricular front, I build small DIY projects for fun, I will try to update my learnings from those [here](/projects/).
